        <h1>False Barriers</h1>
        <h2>By Caroline Chen and Maryam Jameel April 1, 2021, 5 a.m. EDT</h2>
        <p>
          At vaccination sites around the country, people have been turned away
          after being asked for documentation that they shouldn’t need to
          provide, or asked to pay when they owed nothing. In part, this has
          happened as businesses administering the vaccine try to recoup
          administrative fees they are allowed to charge to the government and
          private insurers. To aid them in passing along the bill, major
          pharmacies ask those being vaccinated for their Social Security
          numbers and insurance information. They aren’t supposed to deny a shot
          to people who aren’t covered or try to make them pay the fees. But
          both of those things have happened. Workers at vaccine sites have also
          turned away people who they felt didn’t provide sufficient proof that
          they belonged to an eligible group, demanding to see medical records
          or other evidence of underlying conditions. While the vast majority of
          states don’t require such documentation, government officials haven’t
          always communicated that clearly. The resulting barriers can be higher
          for those less equipped to advocate for themselves, such as
          undocumented people and those who do not speak English. Because of
          this, even as vaccines have become more widely available, they are
          still not easy for some of the most vulnerable people to access.

        <h2>
          You do NOT Need a Social Security Number or Insurance to Get a
          COVID-19 Vaccine
        </h2>
        <p>
          Camille lives in Baltimore with her 77-year-old mother. (She asked to
          be identified only by her first name for privacy reasons.) When a
          nonprofit organization helped her mother get a vaccination appointment
          an hour away in College Park, Maryland, Camille took time off from
          work to drive her there. They’d only brought along her mother’s state
          ID card. But when they went up to the counter at the CVS pharmacy, an
          employee asked for insurance information and a Social Security number.
          Camille’s mother, who is from Togo and is seeking asylum in the United
          States, doesn’t have either of those. Camille said the employee told
          her they’d have to pay if they wanted a vaccine. No one is supposed to
          be charged for the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the CARES Act, and
          immigration status shouldn’t affect eligibility. Many vaccination
          sites ask for insurance and Social Security information so they can
          charge administrative fees to insurance companies or the federal
          government, but those aren’t requirements for being able to get
          vaccinated. Camille told the CVS employee she wasn’t going to pay for
          a vaccine. Her mother, a French speaker who takes weekly English
          lessons, needed Camille to translate what was happening. “I felt so
          embarrassed, and my mom also when I was explaining to her,” she said.
          “She was like, ‘I’m not going to have it because of insurance?’” Not
          wanting to drive an hour back without the vaccine, Camille called
          Tiffany Nelms, executive director of the Baltimore-based nonprofit
          Asylee Women Enterprise, which had set up the appointment for them.
          When Nelms asked the CVS employee why they were having trouble getting
          a vaccine without a Social Security number, the employee “quickly
          backpedaled,” Nelms said. The staffer told Nelms a supervisor would
          override the CVS computer system’s request for an insurance or Social
          Security number. Nelms said she’s worried about others who have less
          access to support. “Not everyone has a bilingual relative to go with
          them who is even comfortable advocating in that way and also has an
          advocate that’s a phone call away,” Nelms said. “A lot of our clients,
          especially those who don’t have legal status yet, if they were asked a
          question like that, they would just leave.” Camille said she’s
          thankful her mother got the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine so they
          don’t have to go back to the CVS for a second shot.

          “We are aware of these isolated incidents in Maryland and are
          committed to addressing inequities related to COVID-19 vaccine access
          in vulnerable communities, with a particular focus on Black and
          Hispanic populations,” a spokesperson for CVS said in a written
          statement regarding Camille’s experience and two other incidents that
          took place at Maryland CVS locations. “No patient, whether they are
          insured or uninsured, has been charged directly for a COVID-19
          vaccine. If a patient does not have insurance, we are required by the
          Health Resources and Services Administration to ask the patient to
          provide either a Social Security number or valid driver’s
          license/state ID #. However, uninsured patients are not required to
          provide this information in order to receive a vaccine from us.”
          Vaccination sites’ arbitrary documentation requirements have been a
          barrier for other Marylanders trying to get vaccinated as well.
          Several Montgomery County public school teachers formed Vaccine
          Hunters-Las Caza Vacunas to help find appointments for eligible
          Marylanders. In March, eight of their clients were initially denied
          vaccines when they showed up for appointments. Most were told they
          needed documentation that isn’t required by the state. All of them
          were immigrants, and most eventually got the vaccine after contacting
          someone from the group to advocate on their behalf.

        <h2>A COVID-19 Vaccine is Free- It's the Law</h2>
        <p>
          While the CDC has made it clear that vaccine providers should not
          charge patients anything, including administrative fees or copays,
          some patients have still received bills for the COVID-19 vaccine. The
          day after Rosanne Dombek, 85, received her second shot at InterMed, a
          primary care practice in Maine, she opened her mail and found a bill.
          For “Covid-19 Pfizer Admin, 1st dose,” her charge was $71.01. “If your
          outstanding balance becomes 120 days past due, the balance will be
          transferred to the Thomas Agency for further collection action,” the
          bottom of the bill said. “It sounded rather final,” said Dombek, who
          is the mother of Lynn Dombek, ProPublica’s research editor. She
          immediately wrote out a check. “I was surprised to get the bill, but
          I’m old enough now that I don’t want any more battles.” When asked
          about Dombek’s bill, InterMed spokesperson John Lamb first said that
          the $71 should have been billed to the patient’s insurance company,
          and that “the correspondence you referenced is likely a request for
          insurance information.” When shown a copy of Dombek’s bill, which did
          not include any such request, Lamb responded, “The statement should
          have included a notice to call us with her insurance information.
          We’re looking into why that was missing.” Yet InterMed’s website
          seemed to indicate that the bill was intentional. In its coronavirus
          FAQ section, the site said: “The COVID vaccine will be provided to
          patients at no cost. However, there will be a vaccine administration
          fee charged to the patient.” When ProPublica questioned InterMed about
          this language, Lamb responded, “Good catch. It was confusing. We’ve
          corrected it to reflect the billing to the insurance provider.” The
          website was subsequently updated. Dombek did not end up mailing her
          check to InterMed. Some residents in New Mexico have also reported
          receiving bills after getting vaccinated. It’s unclear how the CDC or
          its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, aims
          to prevent patients from being billed. A CDC spokesperson noted that
          individuals can call an HHS hotline to report any billing-related
          violations, but referred oversight questions to HHS. HHS didn’t
          respond to requests for comment.
