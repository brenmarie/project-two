      <h1>Distribution</h1>

        As the first coronavirus vaccine takes a major stride toward approval,
        state governments’ distribution plans show many are not ready to deliver
        the shots. The challenge is especially steep in rural areas, many of
        which are contending with a surge of infections, meaning that access to
        the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines may be limited by geography. Pfizer
        announced Monday that its vaccine demonstrated more than 90%
        effectiveness and no serious bad reactions in early trial results — an
        impressive outcome that will pave the way for the company to seek an
        emergency authorization once it collects more safety data for another
        week or two. But establishing that the vaccine is safe and effective is
        just the first step. The Pfizer vaccine is unusually difficult to ship
        and store: It is administered in two doses given 21 days apart, has to
        be stored at temperatures of about minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit and will
        be delivered in dry ice-packed boxes holding 1,000 to 5,000 doses. These
        cartons can stay cold enough to keep the doses viable for up to 10 days,
        according to details provided by the company. The ice can be replenished
        up to three times. Once opened, the packages can keep the vaccine for
        five days but can’t be opened more than twice a day. The vaccine can
        also survive in a refrigerator for five days but can’t be refrozen if
        unused. Health officials haven’t figured out how to get the ultracold
        doses to critical populations living far from cities, according to a
        ProPublica review of distribution plans obtained through open records
        laws in every state. Needing to use 1,000 doses within a few days may be
        fine for large hospital systems or mass vaccination centers. But it
        could rule out sending the vaccine to providers who don’t treat that
        many people, even doctors’ offices in cities. It’s especially
        challenging in smaller towns, rural areas and Native communities on
        reservations that are likely to struggle to administer that many doses
        quickly or to maintain them at ultracold temperatures. The government’s
        vaccine program, Operation Warp Speed, has projected optimism about its
        readiness to distribute the vaccine. On Monday, Gen. Gustave Perna told
        NPR, “I think we’re in a good place,” saying that “with the right
        planning, we can execute it with zero loss of vaccine.” But the federal
        program is only going to be responsible for delivering vaccines to the
        states, which must then figure out on their own how to get the shots to
        the people who need them most. The Centers for Disease Control and
        Prevention asked each state to turn in distribution plans on Nov. 2,
        imagining a scenario in which a vaccine with Pfizer’s specifications
        came first. ProPublica obtained full preliminary plans for 47 states
        (Hawaii, Pennsylvania and Minnesota say they’re still working on
        theirs). Many struggled with how to handle a Pfizer-like vaccine.
        Washington state’s Health Department does not have its own warehouse
        that can store the Pfizer vaccine at a cold enough temperature. Arizona
        expects the Pfizer vaccine cannot be handled by the state’s rural
        communities and tribal lands. North Dakota and Oregon aren’t sure how to
        take care of migrant workers. Kansas’ plan appears to mistakenly assume
        shipments will be far smaller than 1,000 doses. Georgia’s Public Health
        Department is relying on local districts and counties to work out their
        own details.
